# Text-Based-Escape-Game
A python text-based escape game where players must perform various actions and use problem solving skills to escape.

The game starts with the player awakening in a library at night where every door is locked.
The player starts with 30 moves and their objective is to navigate through various rooms
within the library to find and pick up items that may aid in their escape. Equipped with a starting
amount of $100 and an inventory limit of 3 items, the player must strategically manage their
inventory and the items they buy and drop. The player can look at objects to reveal further
information, pick up items in exchange for cash, drop items to gain a percentage of their cash back
and use certain items to gain hints. Furthermore, as an extra layer of challenge, some doors within
the library are locked or stuck and as such the player must solve puzzles and think tactically to
escape.

Also included is unittesting of the main games functions to ensure robustness.
